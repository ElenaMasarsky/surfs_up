# surfs_up
## Overview of the analysis:  
While on vacation in Hawaii last year you discovered a newfound passion for surfing. You've been trying to come up with a plan that will ltet you not just return to Hawaii but live there forever.
You finally come up with an idea that you think is foolproof. A Surf n' Shake shop serving surfboards and ice cream to locals, tourists, and of course yourself. You have some savings you're willing to invest, but we'll eed some real investor backing to get this off the ground. 
So after putting together a strong business plan you reach out to an investor W. Any who is famous for his love of surfing. Your first meeting with him goes extremely well but he has one concern.
What about the weather? He's extremely serious about this. Hie invested in a surf shop early in his career.
However, he didn't ask for any weather analysis and that early venture was rained out of existence.

W. Avy knows your've been learning how to properly analyze data and asks if you can run some analytics on a weather dataset he has from the very island
where you'd like to open your shop: The beautiful Oahu. And so, Aloha, Let's go!
