## Overview of the analysis:  
In this project we are going to analyse an idea to open a Surf n' Shake shop serving surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists at Oahu island in Hawaii. Since we need some real investor backing to get this off the ground, 
we want to put together a strong business plan. We want more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop.
Specifically, we want temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results:

* The average temperature in June is 74.94 and in December is 71.04. We do not observe drastically difference of temperature for this months.  
* Standard deviation for June is 3.2574 and for December is 3.7459, which are not showing us a big difference between temperatures during this months.  
* The minimum temperature in June is 64.0 and in December is 56.0. Looks like some nights in December might be pretty cold.  

## Summary:  
Analysing the tamperature data we can assume that tamperature conditions are pretty similar year-round in Oahu. The tamperature does not change significantly
during the year. And looks like to open shope serving surfboards and ice cream in this island is a good business to invest.
But I would consider to do more analysis to check the precipitation amount for this months and the water temperature, if it's comfortable for swimming, since 
nights in December are pretty cold.
